This is a Windows 8/8.1/RT app that I made. It goes by the name "Star Manager" and is targeted towards Starcraft 2 players. The app lets the user point towards his or hers SC2 profile and the app then display relevant information and statistics regarding that players profile. The app utilizes Blizzards official SC2 REST API: http://blizzard.github.io/api-sc2-docs/

The app can also be used as a tile in the metro grid layout of W8/RT.
